# Lab

1. Come up with a model (some kind of object with various properties)
1. Using React, loop through an array of these "models" and display them on the screen
1. Create a form so that users can add more of these models
1. Make sure your app is separated out into various components.  At the very least, the listing of the models and the form for creating models should be two different components
1. Use redux as a central source of data that the form and list components use to add more models and display the models created
